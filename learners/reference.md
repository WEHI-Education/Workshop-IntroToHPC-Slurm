## Units and Language

A computer's memory and disk are measured in units called *Bytes* (one Byte is
8 bits). As today's files and memory have grown to be large given historic
standards, volumes are noted using the
[SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) prefixes. So
1000 Bytes is a Kilobyte (kB), 1000 Kilobytes is a Megabyte (MB), 1000
Megabytes is a Gigabyte (GB), etc.

History and common language have however mixed this notation with a different
meaning. When people say "Kilobyte", they mean 1024 Bytes instead. In that
spirit, a Megabyte is 1024 Kilobytes.

To address this ambiguity, the [International System of Quantities](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Quantities) standardizes
the *binary* prefixes (with base of 2<sup>10</sup>=1024) by the prefixes Kibi
(ki), Mebi (Mi), Gibi (Gi), etc. For more details, see
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix).
