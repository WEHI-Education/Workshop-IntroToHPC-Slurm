## Running a Batch Job

The most basic use of the scheduler is to run a command non-interactively. Any
command (or series of commands) that you want to run on the cluster is called a
_job_, and the process of using a scheduler to run the job is called _batch job
submission_.

Basic steps are:
  
  * Develop a submission script, a text file of commands, to perform the work
  * Submit the script to the batch system with enough resource specification
  * Monitor your jobs
  * Check script and command output
  * Evaluate your job
  
In this episode, we will focus on the first 4 steps.

### Preparing a job script

In this case, the job we want to run is a shell script -- essentially a
text file containing a list of UNIX commands to be executed in a sequential
manner. 

Our first shell script will have three parts:

* On the very first line, add `/bin/bash`. The `#!`
  (pronounced "hash-bang" or "shebang") tells the computer what program is
  meant to process the contents of this file. In this case, we are telling it
  that the commands that follow are written for the command-line shell.
* Anywhere below the first line, we'll add an `echo` command with a friendly
  greeting. When run, the shell script will print whatever comes after `echo`
  in the terminal.
  * `echo -n` will print everything that follows, _without_ ending
    the line by printing the new-line character.
* On the last line, we'll invoke the `hostname` command, which will print the
  name of the machine the script is run on.

```
$ nano example-job.sh
```
```
#!/bin/bash
echo -n "This script is running on "
hostname
```

::: challenge

### Exercise 1: Run example-job.sh

Run the script. Does it execute on the cluster or just our login node?

:::::: solution
```
$ bash example-job.sh
This script is running on slurm-login01.hpc.wehi.edu.au
```

`slurm-login01.hpc.wehi.edu.au` may change depending on which node you sshed into to run the script.

::::::
:::

This script ran on the login node, but we want to take advantage of the compute nodes, we need the scheduler to queue up `example-job.sh` to run on a compute node.

### Submit a batch job

To submit this task to the scheduler, we use the `sbatch` command.
This creates a _job_ which will run the _script_ when _dispatched_ to
a compute node which the queuing system has identified as being
available to perform the work.

```
$ sbatch example-job.sh
Submitted batch job 11783863
```

And that's all we need to do to submit a job. Our work is done -- now the
scheduler takes over and tries to run the job for us. 

### Monitor your batch job

While the job is waiting
to run, it goes into a list of jobs called the _queue_. To check on our job's
status, we check the queue using the command
`squeue -u $USER`.

```
$ squeue -u $USER
     JOBID    PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
    11783909   regular example- iskander  R       0:06      1 sml-n02
```

ST is status and can be R (RUNNING), PD (PENDING), CA (CANCELLED).
If the job is stuck in pending, REASON column will reflect the reason, which can be any of the following.

* Priority: There are higher priority jobs than yours
* Resources: Job is waiting for resources
* Dependency: Job is waiting for a dependend job to complete
* QOSMaxCpuPerUserLimit: User has used CPUs limit of partition already
* QOSMaxMemPerUserLimit: User has used memory limit of partition already

### Where's the Output?
On the login node, this script printed output to the terminal -- but now, when the job has finished, nothing was printed to the terminal.
Cluster job output is typically redirected to a file in the directory you launched it from. By default, the output file is called `slurm-<jobid>.out`

Use `ls` to find and `cat` to read the file.

::: challenge

### Exercise 2: Get output of running example-job.sh in SLURM

List files in your currrent working directory and look for a file `slurm-11783909.out`, `11783909` will change according to your job id.
And cat the file to see output. 

What is the hostname of your job?

:::::: solution
```
$ cat slurm-11783863.out
This script is running on sml-n02.hpc.wehi.edu.au
```
::::::

### Customising a Job

The job we just ran used all of the scheduler's default options. In a real-world scenario, that's probably not what we want. The default options represent a reasonable minimum. Chances are, we will need more cores, more memory, more time, among other special considerations. To get access to these resources we must customize our job script.

The default parameters on Milton is 2 CPU, 10MB Ram, 48-hours time-limit and runs on the regular partition

You can get details of the job using `sacct` command.

```
$ sacct -j 11783909 -ojobid,jobname,ncpus,reqmem,timelimit,partition -X
JobID           JobName      NCPUS     ReqMem  Timelimit  Partition
------------ ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------
11783909     example-j+          2        10M 2-00:00:00    regular
```

More on SLURM commands in later. 

We can change the resource specification of the job by two ways:

Adding extra options to the sbatch command
``` 
sbatch --job-name hello-world --mem 1G --cpus-per-task 1 --time 1:00:00 example-job.sh
```
Modifying the submission script

```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name hello-world
#SBATCH --mem 1G
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task 1
#SBATCH  --time 1:00:00
echo -n "This script is running on "
hostname
```
    
Submit the job and monitor its status:
    
```
$ sbatch example-job.sh
Submitted batch job 11785584
$ squeue -u $USER
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
          11785584   regular hello-wo iskander  R       0:01      1 sml-n20
```

Comments in UNIX shell scripts (denoted by `#`) are typically ignored, but there are exceptions. Schedulers like SLURM have a special comment used to denote special scheduler-specific options. Though these comments differ from scheduler to scheduler, SLURM's special comment is `#SBATCH`. Anything following the `#SBATCH` comment is interpreted as an instruction to the scheduler. These SBATCH commands are also know as `SBATCH directives`.

**Remember** SLURM directives must be at the top of the script, no command can come before them, nor in between them.

### Resource Requests

One thing that is absolutely critical when working on an HPC system is specifying the resources required to run a job. This allows the scheduler to find the right time and place to schedule our job. As we have seen before, if you do not specify requirements, you will be stuck with default resources, which is probably not what you want.

The following are several key resource requests:

* `--time` or `-t` : Time (wall-time) required for a job to run. The <days> part can be omitted. default = 48 hours on the regular queue
* `--mem`: Memory requested per node in MiB. Add G to specify GiB (e.g. 10G). There is also `--mem-per-cpu`. default = 10M
* `--nodes` or `-N`: Number of nodes your job needs to run on. default = 1 
* `--cpus-per-task`  or	`-c`	Number of CPUs for each task. Use this for threads/cores in single-node jobs.
* `--partition` or `-p`: the partition in which your job is placed. default = regular
* `--ntasks` or `-n` : Number of tasks (u`sed for distributed processing, e.g. MPI workers). There is also `--ntasks-per-node`. default = 1		
* `--gres`: special resources such as GPUs. To specify gpus, use gpu:<type>:<number>, for example, gres=gpu:P100:1, and **you must specify the correct queue (gpuq or gpuq_large)**

Note that just _requesting_ these resources does not make your job run faster, nor does it necessarily mean that you will consume all of these resources. It only means that these are made available to you. Your job may end up using less
memory, or less time, or fewer nodes than you have requested, and it will still run. It's best if your requests accurately reflect your job's requirements. 

In summary, the **main parts of a _SLURM_ submission script**

1- **#! line**: 
  
  This must be the first line of your SBATCH/Slurm script.
  
  `#!/bin/bash`
  
2-**Resource Request**:

  This is to set the amount of resources required for the job. 
  
  ```
  #SBATCH --job-name=TestJob
  #SBATCH --time=00:10:00
  #SBATCH --ntasks=1
  #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1
  #SBATCH --mem=500M
  ```
  
3- **Dependencies**: 

  Load all the modules that the project depends on to execute. For example, if you are working on a python project, youâ€™d definitely require the python module to run your code.
  
  ```
  module load python
  ```
  
4- **Job Steps** 

  Specify the list of tasks to be carried out.

  ```
  echo "Start process"
  hostname
  sleep 30
  echo "End"
  ```
All the next exercises will use scripts saved in the exercise folder which you should have moved to your current directory.

### Exercise 3: Setting appropriate wall-time

List then run job1.sh script in the batch system? What is the output?
Is there an error? How to fix it?
```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -t 00:01:00 

echo -n "This script is running on "
sleep 80 # time in seconds
hostname
```

:::::: solution

After 1 minute the job ends and the output is similar to this
```
cat slurm-11792811.out 
This script is running on slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 11792811 ON sml-n24 CANCELLED AT 2023-05-13T20:41:10 DUE TO TIME LIMIT ***
```
To fix it, change the script to 
```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -t 00:01:20 # timeout in HH:MM

echo -n "This script is running on "
sleep 70 # time in seconds
hostname
```
Try running again.
::::::
:::

Resource requests are typically binding. If you exceed them, your job will be killed. 

The job was killed for exceeding the amount of resources it requested. Although this appears harsh, this is actually a feature. Strict adherence to resource requests allows the scheduler to find the best possible place for your jobs. Even more importantly, it ensures that another user cannot use more resources than they've been given. If another user messes up and accidentally attempts to use all of the cores or memory on a node, SLURM will either restrain their job to the requested resources or kill the job outright. Other jobs on the node will be unaffected. This means that one user cannot mess up the experience of others, the only jobs affected by a mistake in scheduling will be their own.

### Exercise 4: Setting appropriate SLURM directives

List then run Exercises/job2.sh script in the batch system? What is the output?
Is there an error? How to fix it?
```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -t 00:01:00
#SBATCH --gres gpu:P100:1
#SBATCH  --mem 1G
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task 1

#This is  a job that needs GPUs
echo -n "This script is running on "
hostname
```

:::::: solution

When submitting to SLURM, you get an error
```
$ sbatch job2.sh
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested node configuration is not available

```

This is because a GPU was requested without specifying the correct GPU queue, so regular queue was used which has no GPUs. To fix it, change the script to 
```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -t 00:01:00
#SBATCH -p gpuq
#SBATCH --gres gpu:P100:1
#SBATCH  --mem 1G
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task 1

#This is  a job that needs GPUs
echo -n "This script is running on "
hostname
```
Try running again.

### Exercise 5: Make alignment job (job3.sh) work.
:::::: solution
Add the correct SLURM directives to the start of the script
```
#SBATCH --job-name=Bowtie-test.slurm
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH -t 0:15:00
#SBATCH --mem 20G
```

::: challenge

### Exercise 6: Run job3.sh again and monitor progress on the node .


:::::: solution
Run the job
get which node it is running on from `squeue -u $USER`
ssh into the node 
use `top -u $USER`

## Cancelling a Job

Sometimes we'll make a mistake and need to cancel a job. This can be done with the `scancel` command. Let's submit a job and then cancel it using its job number.

```
sbatch example-jobwithsleep.sh
Submitted batch job 11785772
$ squeue -u $USER
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
          11785772   regular example- iskander  R       0:10      1 sml-n20
$ scancel 11785772
$ squeue -u $USER
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
$
```

We can also cancel all of our jobs at once using the -u option. This will delete all jobs for a specific user (in this case, yourself). Note that you can only delete your own jobs.

Try submitting multiple jobs and then cancelling them all.

::: challenge

### Exercise 7: Submit multiple jobs and then cancelling them all.
:::::: solution
```
$ sbatch job1.sh
$ sbatch job1.sh
$ sbatch job1.sh
$ sbatch job1.sh
```
Check what you have in the queue

```
squeue -u $USER
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
          11792908   regular  job1.sh iskander  R       0:13      1 sml-n23
          11792909   regular  job1.sh iskander  R       0:13      1 sml-n23
          11792906   regular  job1.sh iskander  R       0:16      1 sml-n23
          11792907   regular  job1.sh iskander  R       0:16      1 sml-n23
```
Cancel the jobs

```
$ scancel -u $USER
```

Recheck the queue

```
$ squeue -u $USER
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
```

And the queue is empty.

::::::
:::


You can check how busy the queue is through the [Milton dashboards](http://dashboards.hpc.wehi.edu.au/d/main/main?orgId=1)

## SLURM Event notification

You can use `--mail-type` and `--mail-user` to set SLURM to send you emails when certain events occurs, e.g. BEGIN, END, FAIL, REQUEUE, ALL 

```
#SBATCH --mail-type BEGIN
#SBATCH --mail-user iskander.j@wehi.edu.au
```
Adding the above two lines to a submission script will make SLURM send me an email when my job starts running.

## SLURM Output files

By default both standard output and standard error are directed to a file of the name "slurm-%j.out", where the "%j" is replaced with the job id. The file will be saved in the submission directory as we saw before. You can choose where the output files is saved and also separate standard output from standard error using `--output` and `--error`

* `--output` can be used to change the standard output filename and location.
* `--error` can be used to specify where the standard output file shall be saved. If not specified, it will be directed to the standard output file.

In the file names you can use:

* %j for Job Id
* %N for Host name
* %u User name
* %x Job name

For example, running the following 
`sbatch --error=/vast/scratch/users/%u/slurm%j_%N_%x.err --output=/vast/scratch/users/%u/slurm%j_%N_%x.out job1.sh` will create these files

* a standard output file `/vast/scratch/users/iskander.j/slurm11795785_sml-n21_job1.sh.out` and 
* an error files `/vast/scratch/users/iskander.j/slurm11795785_sml-n21_job1.sh.err`.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- `sbatch` is used to submit the job
- `squeue` is used to list jobs in the SLURM queue
- `sacct` is used to show job details
- `#SBATCH` is used in submission scripts to set SLURM directives
- Setting up job resources is a challenge and you might not get the first time
